# Portfolio Project #1: U.S. Medical Insurance
## Overview
For this project, I investigated a [Medical Cost Personal Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance) in a .csv file using the fundamental Python skills I have developed. The insurance.csv dataset contains patient information and insurance cost. This project aimed to analyze various attributes within insurance.csv to learn more about the patient data in the file and gain insight into potential cases for the dataset.
